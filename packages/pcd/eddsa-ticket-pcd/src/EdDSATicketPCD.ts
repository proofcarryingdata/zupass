 *
 * Events may have many Products, such as subsidized tickets, sponsor tickets,
 * organizer tickets, or time-restricted passes. A given Product can only be
 * associated with one Event.
 *
 * In general, consumers of this data will want to be aware of both the event
 * ID and product ID. If providing a service that should be accessible to
 * ticket-holders for an event, and using this PCD as proof of ticket-holding,
 * the consumer should check that both the event ID and product ID match a
 * list of known ticket types, and that the public key (in `proof.eddsaPCD`)
 * matches the public key of the known issuer of the tickets.
 *
 * An example of how this might be done is shown in {@link verifyTicket} in
 * passport-server's issuance service, which is requested by passport-client
 * when verifying tickets.
