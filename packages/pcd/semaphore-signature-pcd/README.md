# `@pcd/semaphore-signature-pcd`

A wrapper of the [Semaphore](https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/) protocol, much like `@pcd/semaphore-group-pcd`, which enables PCD SDK-conforming applications to request, prove, and verify identity-revealing Semaphore protocol signals. I.e. you can use this PCD to effectively 'sign' any message with your Semaphore identity commitment.
